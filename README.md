# Linux Lines
## Installing Stuff:
Within youre desired terminal, you either install as a super user by adding ```sudo``` or not:

Some example:

Arch Linux uses "pacman -S":

- ```pacman -S vlc```

Ubuntu uses "apt=get":

- ``` sudo apt-get istall vlc```

Fedora uses "dnf install":

- ```sudo dnf install vlc```

It is best to search what prefix your distribution uses.

### Some recommendations:
- ffmpegthumbnailer (lets you see thumbnails of images and videos)

- openal-soft.i686 (don't remember what it does but it fixed a problem for me so you should install it)

- fastfetch (see details about your computer/ run program by typing ```fastfetch``` in terminal)

- cmatrix (gimick to rain numbers in terminal)

- libxcb-cursor-dev (allows anki to run (anki installed from their site))

## Extensions

### Gnome Desktop Environment:

#### Method 1 (classic way)
1- within your distro's software app install "gnome-shell extension"

2- Go to [https://extensions.gnome.org/] and install an extension

- make sure to install the right shell version

- shell version could be checked by typing ```fastfetch``` in terminal

- install fastfetch if not installed yet (using the command I just taught you)

3- Extract the zip and place the extension folder in /home/(your user)/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions

- when file starts with a --> . <-- i'm talking about this dot, this means that it is a hidden file. ```Ctrl + h``` should reveal them.

4- Open the extensions program you installed and tick it on (restart pc if needed, but usually not)

#### Method 2 (modern and more convenient)

1- Download ```Evolve-core``` from the user {arcnations-united}

2- Unzip

3- Run the executable

- you might have to right click --> properties --> run as executable

- install all the required prerequisites

4- Go to the extensions tab on the left

5- Click the bottom right icon and install the extension you want.

6- The gear icon lets you configure more Stuff

## Themes

1- Go to [Gnome-look.org]

2- Downlaod the GTK3/4 theme

3- Open that folder and place that singular folder in /home/.Themes

- starts with . thus is hidden

4- Open Evolve program we just installed

5- Click on the theme 

- might take time to show theme in the files app

6- Cursors are placed in /home/.icons/

- if not present, then make Open

- icon packs are also placed here
